# NN-test

A project to learn about how neural networks and training them works.

The neural network in this project is based on 3Blue1Brown's [videos on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=1)

The evolution based training is based on the work of Samuel Arzt's [Deep Learning Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aut32pR5PQA) project.
